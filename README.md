# Suicide-prediction-in-different-parts-of-the-world
Suicide is the act of taking oneâ€™s own life intentionally. It is considered as a major mental health problem in the world. 
The data we used in this project are taken from United Nations Development Program (2018), World Bank (2018), Suicide in the Twenty-First Century (2017) and World health Organization (2018) Suicide prevention. 


The purpose of this project is to redesign the bad visualizations and to make predictions based on given data.

This visualization is interactive and quite flexible, which can show the suicide trend with respect to population, GDP per year and capita for different countries of the world.
